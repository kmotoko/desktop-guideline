## BIOS/UEFI
+ Password-protect the BIOS setup screen
+ Check if there is a separate option to lock down the boot order. If so, make sure that the default boot order first tries the OS bootloader, not the external ports, and then lock the settings.
+ Enable Secure Boot.
+ Enable the hardware security features provided by BIOS (Memory Protection etc.).
