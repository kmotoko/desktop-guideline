## TexStudio
By default use `biber` for bibliography tool. Default in TexStudio is `bibtex`, change it in "Build" section of "Options". If necessary, change the sequence of commands in build and view because you need the following sequence: `compile-bibliography-compile`. In build options, there is `update bibliography before compiling`, if selected you donâ€™t need to change the sequence.
